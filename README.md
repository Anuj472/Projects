For most people in India, agriculture has been their main source of income. Agriculture has been heavily commercialised, which has had a negative impact on our 

ecology. One of the main issues in the Finding plant diseases is a field of agriculture. detection of early preventing disease among others aids in preventing disease

plants, saving significant financial losses.

Effects of plants sickness can have minimal symptoms or can completely destroy an individual.

plantations that have a negative impact on the agricultural sector.

The training dataset is a key factor in how well CNN models work. On sufficiently big datasets, these models typically provide improved outcomes and excellent generalizability. These datasets

for tomato plant disease at this time often do not comprise

sufficient photos in a variety of settings, which is required for making

models with remarkable accuracy. Given that the dataset is small, the model may

using test data from a real setting, overfit and perform poorly.

In order to identify tomato plant illnesses by looking at tomato leaf photos, we have built a deep learning-based framework. By taking an image of the sick leaves 

instead of paying for an expensive expert examination, this technology would assist farmers in the classification of diseases impacting tomato crop.
